The Sacred Rest Stop is a community meeting and meditation space located on 10 acres of bountiful Texas farmland 15 minutes east of downtown Austin.

This was another fun joint project with Recspec, where Laurel was the lead designer and I took on the role of the developer. Highly recommended to also check out the sister site In the Garden Farm at [https://inthegardenfarm.org/](https://inthegardenfarm.org/).
