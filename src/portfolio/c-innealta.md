Innealta Capital is a small financial firm based out of Austin, Texas. The design and development was a collaboration between me and my colleagues at Austinite Web Design. While not the lead on the design, I was tapped for UX feedback and was ultimately the lead developer on the entire project.

The site itself is built with WordPress using the Genesis Framework. The chart/graphs on the site are handled via the Chart.js library (similar to D3).

Built with:

- WordPress
- Genesis Framework
- Advanced Custom Fields
- Chart.js
