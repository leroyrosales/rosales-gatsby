NARAL Pro-Choice Texas is an organization that engages in lobbying, political action, and advocacy efforts to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion in Texas.

My role was part-time web developer, part-time UX designer. The amazing Laurel of Recspec designed the initial site redesign, and together we came up with a design solution for the client's call-to-action banner and integrated feed for multiple social media platforms.

Since NARAL Texas was already familiar with the WordPress backend, the redesign was built on WordPress using the Twig for WordPress library called Timber.

Built with:

- WordPress
- Twig for WordPress
- Advanced Custom Fields
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
