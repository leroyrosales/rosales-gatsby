The National Academy of Construction (NAOCON) is a nationally recognized organization highlighting experts and professionals in the engineering and construction field. This was an intial project started by myself, with design work handled via the crew of Austinite Web Design. Ultimately my role was both project manager and lead developer for the entire project.

The site itself is built with WordPress using the Genesis Framework. The membership portion is handled by S2 Member, chosen as an easy way to manager user logins and user profiles on the frontend, with some lifting for custom membership field types with Advanced Custom Fields.

Built with:

- WordPress
- Genesis Framework
- Advanced Custom Fields
