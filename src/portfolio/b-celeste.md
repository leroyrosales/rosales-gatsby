J. Celeste Lay is a cool political science associate professor at Tulane University. We were introduced via a mutual friend who originally built her a WordPress site in the mid-2000s, and simply hadn't updated the look or feel since then. 

Since my access was strictly limited to what was available via FTP (yeap), I simply worked with the existing WordPress site built on Genesis. After updating the WordPress software and Genesis framework, I put together a unique design that also reflected Tulane's colours.

Built with:

- WordPress
- Genesis Framework
- Advanced Custom Fields
